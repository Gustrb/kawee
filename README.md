## Creating a new command

To create a new command run ```python create-command.py <name_of_your_command>```
(if you are going to add it "by hand" create a class inside commands folder sufixed by Command and add it to the commands.json file, without capitalization)

Example:
  I want to create a TemperatureCommand
   
  So... you should crete a TemperatureCommand in ./commands and add to the commands array in ./commands.json the string temperature
